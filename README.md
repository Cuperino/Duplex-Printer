# Duplex Printer
A halfway done QT5 frontend for PSUtils, the PostScript utilities by Angus Duggan.
The purpose of this project was to provide a GUI to simplify duplex printing on old printers that don't have this capability.

## Project Status
My original goal was to make this software multiplatform, but the software pipes approach turned out to be a lot of trouble on Windows. The so far completed parts of this program work great on Linux and Mac OS. I hope to resume development of this project someday giving support to Linux only, but since I don't know when will that be I'm releasing the source as it was 4 years ago when I wrote it.
